# GovStack: "Information Mediator" Working Group

Architecture and specification sketches for the ITU/DIAL/GIZ/Estonia GovStack
project

## Introduction

The information mediator provides a gateway between external digital
applications and other ICT Building Blocks, thereby ensuring interoperability
and implementation of standards, which is essential for integrating various ICT
Building Blocks and applications.

The scope of the information mediator BB has changed over time, but currently it
consists of two critical "layers":

1. Secure Exchange of Information (think X-Road)
2. A Global PubSub Service

Diagrams for these layers are provided in the `./diagrams` folder and are a good
place to start.
